# Description
*this is a fictitious person*

Valentina's studio website is an eye-catching design that allows her to showcast her work and talent behing the camera lense. Valentina needed a website to create online presence and to bring in new contracts and projects.

# Deployment and Demo

Website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Mickie4/Milestone-Project1)


# Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
 
## UX
 
 What makes Valentina's website special and to stand out is how clear and easy to navigate it really is, along with the way that her information adn work has been layed out it all makes a beautiful and memorable website. 

Landing Page: Has a video showcasting Valentina in a closeup which is responsive in all screen sizes, it gives the user an inmediate taste of the quality of her work.

About Page: Contains a small welcoming message from Valentina and it displays logos of the magazines she has been featured with in the past.

Portraiture Page: It displays Valentina's work that is available for purchase, it it shows every image in a card order with the name and of the product with a button that gives the option to add to a shopping cart. When you click on the image it displays on a lightbox for the user to appreaciate it with more detail. Below every image there is an icon of a shopping cart and a plus sign, if they click on it it opens a modal mocking a shopping card list with the image information, price, option to add more quantity, subtotal and a button to take you to a check out page.

Film Page: it shows 3 videos with their titles and location information for users to get an idea of her work.

Other Work Page: it displays the other categories of photography and filming that Valentina offers at her studio. 

Contact Page: It has a clean and simple contact form for users to send their questions or request directly, opening hours information and a map for users to find the studio with google maps.

All pages have a footer that includes all of Valentina's Social media links and her logo.

This is a quite heavy website due to the high quality resolution on both video and photography; in order to help this issue I have used [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) this reduced the size by 58%.

# User stories

-	As a user I want to be able to see who Valentina has worked with in the past to verify her experience.
-	As a user I need to be able to navigate the website in a simple and intuitive way.
- As a user I want to be able to find Valentina's other pages such as instagram and see how many followers she has there, verify who follows her too as that could be an indication of how high up in the industry she has worked before.
-	As a user I need to be able to get in contact with Valentina and to be able to find her studio and operating information. 

Website Owner:
- As a website owner I will like to showcast my work.
- As a website owner I will like to prompt visitors to follow me on my social media
- As a website owner I will like to recieve in an easy format any queries from potential customers.





# Scalability
•	The option to change the content into a different language (Spanish)
•	Adding an ecommerce page for selling photography.
•   An automatic booking system where customers can reserve slots of the day for a session.


## Technologies Used

- Boostrap 
    - I used this framework to build the website https://getbootstrap.com/
- CSS & HTML
    - Since this was an only frontend project these are the two building blocks I used.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
