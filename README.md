# Description
*this is a fictitious person*

Valentina's studio is a well knowned studio in the heart of Brick Lane; Valentina started her career as a photographer in Milan and has worked with top names in the fashion and film business over the years, she has stablised her studio in London and is ready to become more mainstream. 

# Deployment and Demo

Website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Mickie4/Milestone-Project1)


# Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
 
## UX
 
 Valentina is a very easy going and hip person, I opted for a website that could reflect that aspect of her personality whilst showcasting her top class work and vast experience.

Landing Page: Has a video showcasting Valentina in a closeup which is responsive in all screen sizes, it gives the user an inmediate taste of the quality of her work.

About Page: Contains a small welcoming message from Valentina and it displays logos of the magazines she has been featured with in the past.

Portraiture Page: It displays Valentina's work that is available for purchase, it it shows every image in a card order with the name and of the product with a button that gives the option to add to a shopping cart. When you click on the image it displays on a lightbox for the user to appreaciate it with more detail. Below every image there is an icon of a shopping cart and a plus sign, if they click on it it opens a modal mocking a shopping card list with the image information, price, option to add more quantity, subtotal and a button to take you to a check out page.

Film Page: it shows 3 videos with their titles and location information for users to get an idea of her work.

Other Work Page: it displays the other categories of photography and filming that Valentina offers at her studio. 

Contact Page: It has a clean and simple contact form for users to send their questions or request directly, opening hours information and a map for users to find the studio with google maps.

All pages have a footer that includes all of Valentina's Social media links and her logo.

This is a quite heavy website due to the high quality resolution on both video and photography; in order to help this issue I have used [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) this reduced the size by 58%.
